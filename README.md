# FountAIn

An interactive ready-made for the generated age. English-language microsite with a procedural Three.js urinal inspired by Marcel Duchamp’s Fountain (1917), satirical locally generated captions, and a deliberately reductive flush button.

## Development

Requires Node.js 22.12+ (tested with 24).

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The production site is static: deploy `dist/`. No API keys, model calls, database, or backend are required. Fonts are fetched from Google Fonts, with system fallbacks. The sculpture is an original procedural interpretation, not a museum scan. Historical reference: https://smarthistory.org/marcel-duchamp-fountain/

The Sites project is recorded in `.openai/hosting.json`. Keep its project ID when publishing subsequent versions.
